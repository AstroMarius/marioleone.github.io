# ðŸ¤– Predictive Analytics with Machine Learning

**Leveraging data to build predictive models.**  
A project demonstrating how advanced **machine learning techniques** can be applied to financial and industrial datasets for forecasting and optimization.

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
The goal was to implement scalable ML workflows for **churn prediction**, **risk modeling**, and **time-series forecasting**, ensuring reproducibility and real-world deployment readiness.

## ðŸ”¹ Focus
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation (classification & regression)  
- Hyperparameter tuning and performance optimization  
- Integration of models into production pipelines

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL  
- **ML/AI**: Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- **Data**: Pandas, NumPy, ClickHouse  
- **Ops**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Jupyter

## ðŸ”¹ Highlights
- Built a **gradient boosting model** achieving 85% accuracy in churn prediction  
- Designed a **credit risk model** combining logistic regression and ML ensembles  
- Implemented **LSTM models** for time-series trend forecasting

## ðŸ”¹ Outcome
Delivered **scalable predictive models** that provided actionable insights and improved decision-making in financial and industrial contexts.

Experienced AI Engineer with a strong background in algorithmic trading systems and machine learning applications.

I design and implement low-latency architectures and real-time dashboards powered by intelligent trading agents. By combining C++ performance with Python-based AI models, I build solutions that enhance execution speed and decision-making in high-frequency trading environments. Beyond trading, my expertise extends to developing scalable AI systems and data-driven applications across financial and industrial domains.

## Online Tutoring Booking Dashboard (in development)

Building an online booking dashboard for a tutoring service with focus on reliability, usability and scalability. Core features and stack:

- Tech stack: Laravel (PHP 8.x), MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis (caching/queues), Vue.js (or React) for the frontend, Tailwind CSS, Docker, Nginx, Let's Encrypt, Stripe for payments.
- Key features:
  - Real-time availability calendar and multi-timezone scheduling
  - Booking management for tutors and students, rescheduling and cancellations
  - Secure user authentication, role-based access (admins, tutors, students)
  - Online payments, invoices and refund handling via Stripe
  - Email/SMS/push notifications and reminders (Celery-like queues via Redis)
  - Admin dashboard with analytics: bookings, revenue, tutor utilization
  - Lesson materials, session notes and attachments
  - Tests, CI/CD pipelines, containerized deployments and monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Goals: provide a polished UX for students, an efficient management interface for tutors, and a robust, production-ready backend able to scale with demand.
